/**
 * Provides the specification for arbitrary event types, to be used
 * when collecting counts for and computing probabilities of arbitrary
 * events.  <code>Event</code> objects have to satisfy the rather
 * conflicting design goals of providing an abstraction for events
 * composed of arbitrarily-typed components, efficiency of access,
 * efficiency of storage and notational felicity when composing an
 * event.  Therefore, the general contract of <code>Event</code>
 * objects is that they provide the means to store <i>sequences</i> of
 * different types of components, such that two <code>Event</code>s
 * are guaranteed to be equal if components of the same type have been
 * added in the same order and are pairwise equal.  Put another way,
 * <code>Event</code> objects can be thought of abstractly as a
 * set of lists, with one list for each type of object they are
 * capable of collecting, where two <code>Event</code> objects
 * are equal if all of their corresponding lists are equal.  This contract
 * achieves notational convenience when composing an event, because
 * {@link MutableEvent#add(Object)} will add the specified object to the
 * appropriate list.  For example, if two <code>MutableEvent</code> objects
 * <code>event1</code> and <code>event2</code> are composed via the following
 * code
 * <pre>
 * event1.add(new Integer(2)).add("foo").add(new Integer(3));
 * event2.add("foo").add(new Integer(2)).add(new Integer(3));
 * </pre>
 * it is guaranteed that <code>event1.equals(event2)</code> will return
 * <code>true</code>.
 * <p>
 * <code>Event</code> objects must explicitly publish the run-time types of
 * objects they are capable of collecting, and these types may include
 * <code>Object</code>, as well as primitive types.  This publishing is
 * accomplished via the method {@link #getClass(int)}, which maps integers
 * in the range [0,{@link #numTypes}) to <code>Class</code> objects.
