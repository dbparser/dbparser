<p>
Default package for model structure classes (subclasses of {@link
danbikel.parser.ProbabilityStructure}).  A model structure class is composed
with a {@link danbikel.parser.Model} object to form a submodel for a particular
type of element that is output in the generative process (such as, for example,
the head child of some parent nonterminal, or a subcat frame).
</p>
<p>
The package in which to find such classes can be changed via the
{@link danbikel.parser.Settings#modelStructurePackage} setting.
