Implements a framework for developing statistical syntactic parsers
that, unlike previous approaches, uses a language/Treebank module for
a great deal of language-independence and supports models that
incorporate <a target="_blank"

Several of the classes in this package, particularly the smaller
classes that serve primarily as record data structures, implement a
<code>copy</code> method.  The general contract of this method is to
return a deep copy of the object.  Java does not permit this sort of
semantics to be formally specified, as there is no way for an abstract
class or interface to specify that a method of an implementing class
must return its own type, because types are not parameterized; hence,
we are specifying the contract for this method name here.  However,
all classes that implement <code>copy</code> also implement the {@link
java.lang.Cloneable Cloneable} interface, where the <code>clone</code>
method simply calls the class' <code>copy</code> method.
