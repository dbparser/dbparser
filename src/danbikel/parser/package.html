Provides the core framework of this extensible statistical parsing engine.
Unlike previous approaches, the framework encapsulates all language- and
Treebank-specific information in a language package extension, providing a
great deal of language-independence.

Several of the classes in this package, particularly the smaller
classes that serve primarily as record data structures, implement a
<code>copy</code> method.  The general contract of this method is to
return a deep copy of the object.  Java does not permit this sort of
semantics to be formally specified, as there is no way for an abstract
class or interface to specify that a method of an implementing class
must return its own type, because types are not parameterized; hence,
we are specifying the contract for this method name here.  However,
all classes that implement <code>copy</code> also implement the {@link
java.lang.Cloneable Cloneable} interface, where the <code>clone</code>
method simply calls the class&rsquo; <code>copy</code> method.
