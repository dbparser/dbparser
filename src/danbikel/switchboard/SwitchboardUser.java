/**
 * An interface that both types of users of the switchboard (clients
 * and servers) must implement, providing useful information about the
 * switchboard user, as well as a means to determine whether the
 * switchboard user is alive and to tell it when it is allowed to die.
 * <p>
 * Concrete implementations of this interface must ensure that they
 * appropriately deal with switchboard failures.  An acceptable
 * response to a switchboard failure is either simply to commit
 * suicide, or to wait patiently for a new switchboard to become
 * available.  The latter option is preferable when developing
 * fault-tolerant systems.  Detection of a swtichboard's failure will
 * necessarily occur as a <code>RemoteException</code> during an
 * invocation of one of the switchboard's methods.  Because client and
 * server state (such as unique IDs) is <i>not</i> maintained by the
 * switchboard in its log file, it is necessary for switchboard users
 * to re-register before re-invoking the method that had failed.
 * Another consequence of the lack of persistence of switchboard user
 * state is that if a client is in the middle of processing an object
 * obtained from the switchboard when the switchboard goes down, it
 * should cease processing, re-register and get a new object via the
 * {@link SwitchboardRemote#nextObject} method.  The
 * <code>AbstractSwitchboardUser</code> class provides methods to make
 * compliance with the general contract of this interface straightforward
 * for concrete subclasses.
 * <p>
 * The interface hierarchy of <code>SwitchboardUser</code>, <code>Client</code>
 * and <code>Server</code> is mirrored by the implementation hierarchy
 * of <code>AbstractSwitchboardUser</code>, <code>AbstractClient</code>
 * and <code>AbstractServer</code>:
 * <pre>
 *   Interface Hierarchy          Implementation Hierarchy
 *   -------------------          ------------------------
 *     SwitchboardUser             AbstractSwitchboardUser
 *       /        \                  /             \
 *      /          \                /               \
 *   Client      Server       AbstractClient   AbstractServer
 * </pre>
 * The purpose of the abstract implementation hierarchy is to provide
 * convenient default implementations that comply with their respective
 * interfaces' general contracts.
 * <p>
 * <b>A note on fault tolerance</b>: In order to ensure the fault-tolerance
 * of switchboard users, concrete implementors of this interface should
 * ensure that they use socket factories that set the <tt>SO_TIMEOUT</tt>
 * values of their TCP/IP sockets to some integer greater than 0.  This
 * will mean that the Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP) implementation
 * can never hang when a remote object crashes (as is possible with
 * Sun's JRMP implementation).  {@link danbikel.util.TimeoutSocketFactory 
 * TimeoutSocketFactory} is one such factory for creating both client- and
 * server-side sockets.  Implementors that use sockets other than TCP/IP
 * sockets should have similar non-infinite timeouts.
