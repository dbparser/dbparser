 * fixed size, several of the optional operations from <code>List</code> are
 * overridden here to document explicitly that they should <i>not</i> be
 * supported.  Another consequence is that all implementors should have at
 * least one argument in their constructors that is an <code>int</code>,
 * to specify the fixed size of the list to be created, and all elements are
 * initially <code>null</code> unless otherwise set via a constructor.  A
 * final consequence is that the {@link #shift(Object)} method may be
 * efficiently implemented for lists of fixed size, by employing a circular
 * buffer (indeed, this was one of the prime motivations for the creation of
 * this interface).
