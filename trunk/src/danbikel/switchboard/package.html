Provides classes to implement a distributed client-server environment,
with a central switchboard responsible for assigning clients to
servers and for doling out objects to clients for processing.  The
switchboard obtains objects for processing from one or more input
files.  When clients finish processing an object, they return it to
the switchboard, and when all the objects of an input file have been
processed, the switchboard assembles them in the order in which they
appeared in the input file and outputs them to an output file.
<p>
The distributed system implemented by this package is <i>fault
tolerant</i>, in that any client or server can fail, and the rest of
the system will recover gracefully.  If a client fails in the middle
of processing an object, the switchboard pushes the unprocessed object
onto an internal stack, so that another client may processs it.  If a
server fails, clients will be notified to request a new server.  If
the switchboard itself fails, a new switchboard may be brought up and
effectively recover the same state at the time of the crash, without
having to restart clients and servers.
