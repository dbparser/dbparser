This collection of packages provides a framework for an extensible statistical
parsing engine.  Unlike previous approaches, the framework encapsulates all
language- and Treebank-specific information in a separate module to be
specified at run-time, providing a great deal of language-independence.
</p>
<p>
<b>A quick note on <i>extensible</i> versus <i>portable</i></b>:
This parser is <i>extensible</i> to new Treebanks and/or langauges, as opposed
to being <i>portable</i>.  The difference lies in what the developer must do to
allow the parsing engine to work with a new Treebank and/or language, as well
as whether the changes are recognized at compile-time or run-time.  A
<i>portable</i> engine implies that the developer would need to make changes to
the engine itself to make sure that it can work in the new domain, and then
recompile the entire engine to get a language- or Treebank-specific version.
This <i>extensible</i> engine, on the other hand, requires only that the
developer provide an additional set of classes&mdash;a <i>language
package</i>&mdash;to be loaded at run-time, without having to touch the source
code of the engine itself or re-compile it.  Other ways in which this framework
is extensible include, but are not limited to,
<ul>
<li> the ability to specify different top-level and back-off dependencies for
the various parameter classes to be used,
<li> the ability to specify new parameter classes within the existing
head-driven framework and
<li> the ability to specify richer types of lexical information, such as the
lexico-semantic information available in the <a
href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn">WordNet</a> database.
</ul>
